# Lab6-Assignment
Group assignment with: Simon Cochran, Jake Shaw, Daniel Otto-Manzano.

We made two programs, one that asks for the users name and then the year they were born, the program then roughly finds their age.

The other program asks for the users name and age and prints it back to them.

## Getting Started 

1. Log into SCI JupyterHub and start a terminal 
2. Type in git clone git@github.com:SimonJCo/Lab6-Assignment.git and hit the enter key
3. This should download a folder to your JupyterHub with the code (it should be called Lab06-Assignment)
4. Double click the new folder in the file explorer. You should see the contents.
5. Launch the test code.ipynb notebook. Then play around with the code and see what it does.

## Using Code

Both test code and testCode perform different functions however, they are very similar programs. test code.ipynb asks for the users birth year, then finds their age in 2023. testCode.ipynb asks the user for their name and age, then prints a message back to the user.
